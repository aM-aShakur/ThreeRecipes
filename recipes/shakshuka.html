  <p>Shakshuka is a Middle Eastern and North African style dish. I am half-Moroccan so loving this dish is very natural.</p>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>

  <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>5 large fresh tomatoes, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>6 eggs</li>
      <li>4 pita bread rounds</li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Steps</h4>

  <ol> 
      <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Add chopped tomatoes and garlic, stirring occasionally, until liquid has cooked out of tomatoes.</li>
      <li>Carefully break eggs over tomatoes without breaking yolks. Lightly season with salt, reduce heat and cover.</li>
      <li>Simmer covered for 20 minutes, or until yolks are fully cooked.</li>
      <li>Adjust seasoning with salt as needed. Serve with pita pockets.</li>
  </ol>
